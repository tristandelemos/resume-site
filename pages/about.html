        <h2>My Time in Korea</h2>
        <p>During my time in South Korea, I taught English as a second language to Korean children ages 5 to 12.
            I really enjoyed living in a new country and learned so much about myself and other cultures.
            I was able to explore all over South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.
